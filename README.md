# Machine Learing Project
This project was developed as part of a Machine Learning & Data Mining course. The goal was to build predictive models that classify whether an individual is at risk of developing diabetes, based on medical, demographic, and behavioral data. The work included exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, neural network modeling with undersampling strategies, and evaluation metrics (with emphasis on recall to reduce false negatives). In addition, we integrated an economic cost-benefit model to assess the real-world impact of false positives and missed diagnoses.
